NECKAR

WHAT

Sample view in Android with custom pinch gesture detector

NAME

Named after the river that flows through cities like Heilbronn or Heidelberg, in the beautiful south of Germany.

PURPOSE

As I didn't find any proper view written in Java for Android with a custom pinch gesture detector, I did it myself.

USEFUL FOR YOU IF

You want to add to your view in Android a pinch gesture detector besides other gestures, that are already managed by classes like ScaleGestureDetector(), DoubleTapListener() or LongClickListener().

HOW

It detects two fingers and calculate (through Pythagorean Theorem) the distance between the fingers before and after the gesture. So that we can tell if it's a 'zoom in' or a 'zoom out' gesture.
